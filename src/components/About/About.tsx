            I am a third-year student at New York City College of Technology,
            CUNY and majoring in data science and interned at 2 companies in
            backend development and data analysis roles. I also am part of the
            8th cohort of CUNY Tech Prep as a fellow and also an ambassador for
            CTP. I am passionate about learning more about this world through
            different lenses especially through data.

            My goal is to discover, analyze and harness — the power of 'data'.
            Data is undoubtedly the new gold of the era we live in.

            When I am not in front of a screen, I’m most likely enjoying the
            local food and wonderful weather while reading or listening to
            music.
